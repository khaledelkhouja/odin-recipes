        <h2>What Is Couscous?</h2>
            <p>Couscous can refer to two different things: either
            the coarsely ground durum wheat called semolina,or the
            popular North African dish with couscous.</p>

            <p>Couscous is a staple in all Maghreb cuisines. 
            It is known as the national dish in Tunisia, but 
            also in Algeria and Morocco, as well as in Mauritania
            and Libya. Tunisian couscous is one of the countless
            variations of this delicious dish.</p>
            <p>It is believed that the original name for couscous
            (Arabic: كسكس) may have come from the Arabic word kaskasa , 
            which means “to pound small” or from the Berber word seksu , 
            which means “rounded” or “well rolled”.</p>

        <h2>Preparation steps</h2>
        <p>Preparation: <strong>50 min</strong> </p>
        <p>Cooking: <strong>1h 20 min</strong> </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Finely chop the onion. Brown it in olive oil in the bottom of the couscoussière or the bottom of a basic casserole dish.
                Once colored, add the meat cut into pieces.
                Brown, add two large tablespoons of tomato puree.
                Slightly dry out the concentrate, stirring constantly.
                Add 4 glasses of water.</li>
            <li>Cut the carrots lengthwise.
                Cut the potatoes into 4.
                Add carrots, potatoes and peppers to the casserole dish or couscoussière.</li>
            <li>Stir everything and cover with water.
                Add the spices and stir well again.
                Salt and pepper to taste.</li>
            <li>
                Reduce the heat to medium and cook until the meat breaks away and the vegetables are cooked through.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, put the semolina in a large dish and moisten it with 2 large glasses of olive oil.
                Shell it with a fork or by hand until it is well separated. 
                Salt.
                Put the semolina in the top of the couscoussière and cook for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.
                Take out the semolina and wet it with water. Mix well so that the grains do not stick.
                Put back on the couscoussière.
                At the end of cooking the semolina, add about 2 ladles of the couscous sauce (without vegetables) and stir well.</li>
            <li>Pipe the semolina in a circle, leaving a well in the middle.

                Add the sauce. Arrange the carrots in a 'sun' shape with the potatoes.
                
                Avoid soaking the semolina with too much sauce. Being steamed it is very tender and does not need too much sauce.</li>
